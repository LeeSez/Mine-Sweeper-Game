## Achieved Goal

I had two main reasons to create this game. 
First of all, to advance and face various challenges throughout the proccess infavor of becoming a better programmer.
Secondly, I had always hoped to replicate the widly known game as it was one of my childhood favorites, almost feels like I made my dream come true.

All in all, I reckon that the proccess had changed the why I work hamd in hand with the way I think and reverse engineer convoluted problems regarding the algorithm. I'm very proud of the project as it is one of my first real prjects, and I believe it's only the beginning.

## Instructions 

Beginning of a game ------------------------------------
Each game will start with all 225 cells unmarked & unrevealed, leaving you the option to mark them as you wish.

End of a game ------------------------------------------
All game will end in one of two ways: you lost of you won.

if you won - all the marked cells will trun green and a message will pop up saying "congratulation, you won!".

if you lost - all unmarked mines will turn red, all correctly marked mines will turn green and incorrectly marked mines will turn black. 

Marking / unmarking a mine -----------------------------
Use the right mouse click to mark and unmark a mine. If the mark was marked successfully, it would change color to red.

Revealing a cell ---------------------------------------
To reveal a cell click on the cell with the left mouse click, if revealed a mine, you lost and all mine on board will be marked accordingly. otherwise, a number will appear on a white cell.

Changing the difficulty --------------------------------
You may choose to change the difficulty of the game by placing more mines on the board. If you wish to do so, on the left of the board you will find a slider dedicated to changing the amoung of mines, each time you move the slider, the game will restart.
